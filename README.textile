h2. Untar action for Automator

This project implements a simple 'untar' action for use in Automator workflows. It performs essentially the same task as 'Open Finder Items', with the exception that it won't causes the Finder to spawn a new window for each tar file it expands.

It will accept a list of files (which should all be tar files) as either URLs or paths, and will return whichever of those items was successfully extracted.

This item is required for the "Download APSL Source":http://github.com/AlanQuatermain/DarwinSourceDownloader workflow.
