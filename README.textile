h2. Untar action for Automator

This project implements a simple 'untar' action for use in Automator workflows. It performs essentially the same task as 'Open Finder Items', with the exception that it won't causes the Finder to spawn a new window for each tar file it expands.

It will accept a list of files (which should all be tar files) as either URLs or paths, and will return whichever of those items was successfully extracted. It will stop upon any failure; this may become an option in future.

This item is required for the "Download APSL Source":http://github.com/AlanQuatermain/DownloadDarwinSource workflow.
